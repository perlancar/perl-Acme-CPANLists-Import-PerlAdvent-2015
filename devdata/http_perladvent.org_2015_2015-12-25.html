<div class='pod'><p>Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and good tidings to you all. We&#39;ve concluded the sixteenth annual Perl Advent Calendar in good cheer and good spirits.</p>

<h3 id="Without-You-This-Would-Not-Be-Possible">Without You This Would Not Be Possible</h3>

<p>The Perl Advent Calendar is a team effort, and it wouldn&#39;t be possible to produce it without the help from everyone involved. This year thanks are due for the contributions made by Alex Balhatchet, Arthur Axel &quot;fREW&quot; Schmidt, Dave Cross, Dave Rolsky, David Cantrell, David Precious, Graham Ollis, Ivan Kruglov, James Laver, Johann Rolschewski, Marcus Ramberg, Mark Fowler, Masayuki Matsuki, Neil Bowers, Olaf Alders, openstrike, Pete Houston, Paul &quot;LeoNerd&quot; Evans, Ricardo SIGNES, Sergey Romanov, Shoichi Kaji, and Yanick Champoux. Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>And of course, it wouldn&#39;t be possible without all the readers enjoying the articles each day, so thanks to you too.</p>

<p>In early February 2016 I&#39;ll be starting the whole process over again with a call for participation for the 2016 Perl Advent Calendar. If you&#39;re reading then then I&#39;d strongly recommend you write an article, especially if you&#39;ve not written one before!</p>

<h3 id="The-Gift-of-The-CPAN">The Gift of The CPAN</h3>

<p>Advent may be once again over but the CPAN is the gift that keeps on giving, and each year it gets better and better!</p>

<p>Right now as I write this the CPAN has one hundred and fifty eight thousand five hundred and fifty nine modules published to it. That means that - in addition to updates to existing modules - since I wrote this Christmas Day entry last year for the 2014 Advent Calendar sixteen thousand eight hundred and ten new modules have been uploaded, or in other words a growth of nearly 12% in just one year!</p>

<p>To put this in some context, if you took just five minutes to install, examine and play with each of these new modules it&#39;d be nearly the end of February before you were done (If you were to do the same for every module on the CPAN...you&#39;d miss next year&#39;s advent calendar totally and you&#39;d finally be done in June 2017!) That is, assuming of course, you didn&#39;t stop to sleep or eat or anything else.</p>

<p>This sounds like a lot of work! Where can you find out about all this the <i>lazy</i> way? As always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can search for Perl modules at <a href="https://metacpan.org/">metacpan</a>
  where you can also see a list of <a href="https://metacpan.org/recent">recently
  published modules</li><li><a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a> offers a ratings
  and reviews of Perl modules.  It's like a democratic advent calendar each day
  of the year!</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> provides one small
  succinct email a week with a summary of the interesting things happing in Perl
  that week, including new modules, interesting articles and upcoming events.</li>
  <li><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a> hosts a vast number of
  Perl blogs if you're looking for more articles to read throughout the year.  The <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">
  Perl Ironman Challenge</a> links to a lot more blogs as part of the <em>updating
  your Perl blog weekly</em> challenge</li>
  <li>Of course, if you want more Perl Advent articles, there's always the
  previous <a href="http://perladvent.org/archives.html">fifteen years of advent
  calendar</a> to go through.  Happy reading!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="That-One-More-Thing">That One More Thing</h3>

<p>This Christmas is the Christmas many in the Perl community have been waiting for: The one where we get a whole new programming language!</p>

<p>Perl 6 is a sister language to Perl 5: Rebuilt from scratch, with exciting refined syntax and capabilities, Perl 6 is designed to appeal to the discerning Perl programmer. It&#39;s been under development for many years, but finally this Christmas we&#39;re getting all our Christmases at once: The first major release!</p>

<p>You can find out more about Perl 6 over at <a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a>. Heck, they&#39;ve even got their own <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/">advent calendar</a>...</p>

<p>Until next year....Merry Christmas, one and all.</p>
